- Rename project to z3c.ptcompat to deal with setuptools issues (as discussed
  on zope-dev http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-December/033820.html)

- Added optional option ``doctest`` for output checker to allow usage
  with alternative implementations, e.g. the Zope doctest
  module. [malthe]

- Added tests for meta-directives and fixed some minor errors. [malthe]

- Added update-tool to walk a source tree and automatically rewrite
  template import statements in each file. [malthe]

- Added meta-directives for browser pages and viewlets. These build
  upon the original implementations, but make sure that the Chameleon
  template engine is used. [malthe]

- Added ``PageTemplateFile``. [malthe]
