Changelog
=========

1.0.1 (2012-02-15)
------------------

- Move ``zope.testing`` to test dependencies, add undeclared dependencies.


1.0 (2011-10-10)
----------------

- Update implementation to use component-based template engine
  configuration, plugging directly into the Zope Toolkit framework.

  The package no longer provides template classes, or ZCML directives;
  you should import directly from the ZTK codebase.

  Also, note that the ``PREFER_Z3C_PT`` environment option has been
  rendered obsolete; instead, this is now managed via component
  configuration.

- Upgrade to Chameleon 2.x.

0.5.7 (2010-11-25)
------------------

- Added not yet declared test dependency on ``zope.testing``.

- Fixed test tear down so tests can be run multiple times.


0.5.6 (2010-04-19)
------------------

- Remove broken templates from registry during engine migration. In
  some testing situation, stale templates would be tracked in the
  regsitry.

- Existing template instances are now migrated to the right engine
  when using the ``enable`` and ``disable`` methods. [malthe]

0.5.5 (2009-07-24)
------------------

0.4 (2009-02-10)
----------------

- Rename project to z3c.ptcompat to deal with setuptools issues (as discussed
  on zope-dev http://mail.zope.org/pipermail/zope-dev/2008-December/033820.html)

- Added optional option ``doctest`` for output checker to allow usage
  with alternative implementations, e.g. the Zope doctest
  module. [malthe]
