2.0 (2016-09-02)
----------------

- Added support for Python 3.4, 3.5, PyPy and PyPy3.

- Dropped support for Python 2.6.


2.0.0a1 (2013-02-25)
--------------------

- Added support for Python 3.3.

  fixed in Chameleon.)

  ``zope.interface.implementer`` decorator.

- Dropped support for Python 2.4 and 2.5.


1.0.1 (2012-02-15)
------------------

- Move ``zope.testing`` to test dependencies, add undeclared dependencies.


1.0 (2011-10-10)
----------------

- Update implementation to use component-based template engine
  configuration, plugging directly into the Zope Toolkit framework.

  The package no longer provides template classes, or ZCML directives;
  you should import directly from the ZTK codebase.

  Also, note that the ``PREFER_Z3C_PT`` environment option has been
  rendered obsolete; instead, this is now managed via component
  configuration.

- Upgrade to Chameleon 2.x.

0.5.7 (2010-11-25)
------------------

- Added not yet declared test dependency on ``zope.testing``.

- Fixed test tear down so tests can be run multiple times.


0.5.6 (2010-04-19)
------------------

- Remove broken templates from registry during engine migration. In
  some testing situation, stale templates would be tracked in the
  regsitry.

- Existing template instances are now migrated to the right engine
  when using the ``enable`` and ``disable`` methods. [malthe]

0.4 (2009-02-10)
----------------

- Rename project to z3c.ptcompat to deal with setuptools issues (as discussed
